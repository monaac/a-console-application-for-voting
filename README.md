This program creates a list of candidates and a dictionary to store their votes. The vote function adds

a vote for a selected candidate. The program then enters a loop to allow the user to vote by entering the number of their desired candidate. The choice is checked for validity, and if it's valid, a vote is registered using the vote function. If the user inputs 0, the loop is exited. Finally, the election results are displayed, showing the number of votes each candidate received.
